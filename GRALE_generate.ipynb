The user has given me a query molecule with specific features, and they've provided some context and constraints. Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what the query molecule looks like. From the SMILES notation provided: CCCC(C)(C)CC, it seems like it's a pentane derivative. Let me visualize it. The SMILES string starts with four carbon atoms in a row (CCCC), followed by a carbon that has two methyl groups attached (C(C)(C)), then another carbon (C), and finally two more carbons (CC). So, it's a five-carbon molecule where the second carbon (position 2) has two methyl groups and the fourth carbon has two hydrogens attached. Wait, no, actually, the SMILES notation is a bit tricky. Let me parse it properly.\\n\\nThe SMILES is CCCC(C)(C)CC. Breaking it down:\\n- CCCC: This is four carbons in a row, with the fourth one having substituents.\\n- (C)(C): This indicates two methyl groups attached to the fourth carbon.\\n- CC: This is two more carbons attached\", \"Okay, I need to generate a factual description of the [QUERY MOLECULE] strictly based on its feature card.

The elements mentioned are C=1, O=4, and S=1. The molecular weight is 112.099000. The query also specifies that the molecule contains sulfur and oxygen, making it heteroatom-rich.\\n\\nLooking at the structural templates, Template 1 (Tanimoto: 0.50) describes the molecule as the dimethyl ester of sulfuric acid. It mentions it has a role as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent. Another template (Ref 1) refers to it as a hydrate and a metal sulfate, containing a zinc sulfate. However, since the query's SMILES includes sulfur, Ref 1 might not be the best fit as it refers to zinc sulfate.\\n\\nTherefore, the most accurate description would be that the molecule is the dimethyl ester of sulfuric acid, playing roles as an alkylating agent and an\", 'Okay, I need to generate a factual description of the QUERY MOLECULE strictly based on its feature card.

Let me think about what that structure looks like.\\n\\nThe SMILES notation is a way to represent chemical structures using strings of letters. In this case, the SMILES is C#CCCCCCCCCC. Breaking that down, it starts with a carbon (C), then a triple bond (#), followed by a series of Cs. So, it's a chain of 11 carbons with a triple bond at the end.

So, there's a carbon connected to another carbon, then an oxygen, then a carbonyl group (C=O), followed by a carbon connected to another carbon, which is connected to another carbon that has a methyl group (C).

That matches what I know about glyceraldehyde derivatives. Glyceraldehyde is a six-carbon molecule with an aldehyde group on carbon 1, so when it undergoes formal condensation with an O-methylhydroxylamine, it forms this oxime O-ether.\\n\\nI should also consider the functional groups. It has two ketone groups and an alcohol group, which explains the O= in the SMILES. The presence of the O-methyl group indicates that it's a glycol because it's a 1,2-diol or a glycol.

The elements are carbon and oxygen. The molecular weight is 90.078000, which is correct for this structure. It's an alpha-hydroxy ketone because the hydroxyl group is attached to the alpha carbon (the first carbon) of a ketone.\\n\\nLooking at the tags, it's categorized under heteroatom-rich, which makes sense because it contains oxygen atoms.

Zinc has an atomic number of 30, so the number of protons is 30, electrons is 30, and neutrons is 30 (since it's neutral). The natural abundance is 0, which means it's not naturally occurring.

Since it's an alkaline earth metal, it's a strong base and can cause a wide range of chemical reactions.\\n\\nIt's an adjuvant, which means it's used to treat or prevent certain diseases. Beryllium is often used in cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, because it has strong antitumoral properties.\\n\\nAs an epitope, beryllium can be used in immunotherapies to target cancer cells. This makes it a potential tool in developing targeted therapies for cancer.\\n\\nAdditionally, beryllium is a metal allergen, which means it can be a source of allergens for people with sensitivities to metals. This could lead to allergic reactions or asthma, so it's important to be cautious when using it in large quantities.\\n\\nI should also mention that beryllium is\", \"Alright, I need to generate a factual description of the QUERY molecule strictly based on its feature card.

The user wants me to generate a factual description of a molecule strictly based on its feature card. They've provided a detailed card, so I need to make sure I use the exact details from the card.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the feature card. It mentions SMILES: [S-]SSSS, which indicates a molecule with a sulfur atom connected to four other sulfur atoms. That suggests it's a sulfur hydride or a tetrasulfide.\\n\\nLooking at the context, there's a template that uses SMILES: [S-]SSS for a trisulfide. The SMILES here is different because it's [S-]SSSS instead of [S-]SSS. This means the molecule has five sulfur atoms, not four. So, it's a tetrasulfide.\\n\\nThe feature card mentions that it's a conjugate base of a tetrasulfane and a conjugate acid of a tetrasulfide(2-).

The SMILES notation is CC(=O)N[C@@H](CSC(=O)[C@]1([C@@H](O)C(C)C)NC(=O)[C@H](C)[C@@H]1O)C(=O)O.

The glycerol has a carboxy group, a thiol group, and a carboxyl group.\\n\\nLooking at the other features, the molecule is a S-substituted N-acetyl-L-cysteine and a thioester. It is derived from a glyceric acid. So, the description should reflect these characteristics.\", \"Okay, so I need to describe the QUERY molecule strictly based on its feature card.

That's a L-tyrosine derivative. Comparing the two, Tanimoto has a methyl group on the alpha carbon, while the QUERY has a methoxy group on the phenyl ring. So, the main difference is the substituent on the phenyl ring.\\n\\nNow, I need to think about the tags. Tanimoto has 'aromatic_character' and 'ring_system'. For the QUERY, I can add 'phenyl_character' since it's a phenyl derivative.\\n\\nThe function is to provide a factual description, so I should mention that it's an L-tyrosine derivative with a methoxy substituent on the phenyl ring\", \"Okay, so I need to describe the QUERY molecule strictly based on its feature card. Let me see, the feature card has a SMILES notation: CC(N)=NCC1=CC=CC(CN)=C1. That's interesting. Let me break that down.\\n\\nFirst, the SMILES notation: CC(N)=NCC1=CC=CC(CN)=C1. Breaking it down, the molecule has a central carbon connected to two methyl groups (C-C(N)=N). Then, there's a ring structure: C1=CC=CC(CN)=C1.

Oxygen is the only halogen, so that's 0 halogens. No metals or other elements mentioned.

The molecule starts with CC1(C), which indicates a carbon connected to another carbon, forming a ring. The next part, CC(COS(C)(=O)=O), suggests that a methyl group (C) is connected to a sulfonyl group (COS(C)(=O)=O). Then, the ring continues with C(=O)O1, which is an ester group attached to the oxygen of the ring.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the molecule has a four-membered ring (since the SMILES shows a ring with five atoms, including the oxygen). The ring is formed by a methyl group (C), a methyl group (C), a carbon attached to a sulfonyl group (COS(C)(=O)=O), and an oxygen (O). The oxygen is part of the ring, so it must be connected to another carbon, which is part of the methyl group.

High natural abundance of 6 atoms, no halogens, no metals, no formal charges, 12 aromatic atoms, 20 ring atoms, 39 undirected bonds, 19 conjugated bonds, 20 hybridizations, 4 chirality centers, and 0 radicals. The tags are aromatic_character and ring_system.\\n\\nNow, I should think about how to describe this in a factual manner. The description should mention it's a stilbenoid, a stilbenoid derivative, an organic heterotricyclic compound, and a member of resorcinols. It should also note that it's\", \"Okay, so I need to generate a factual description of the QUERY MOLECULE based on the given feature card. The feature card details include SMILES, atoms_total, elements, molecular_weight, high_natural_abundance_atoms, nuclear_spins, halogens_total, metals_or_other_total, formal_charge_net, aromatic_atoms, ring_atoms, undirected_bonds, bond_types, conjugated_bonds, hybridization, chirality_centers, radical_atoms, tags, and tags.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the SMILES provided: CONC(=O)C1=CC(OC)=CC(C2=CC=CC=N2)=N1. Breaking this down, I see a carbon connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is then connected to a carbon ring. The ring has two substituents: one is a hydroxymethyl group (C-O-) and the other is an aminocarbonyl group (N-C(=O)-). The ring system is 2,2'-bipyridine, meaning it's a six-membered ring with two pyridine rings connected at two positions. \\n\\nLooking at the elements, I have carbon (12), nitrogen (3), and oxygen (\", \"Okay, so I need to generate a factual description of the QUERY MOLECULE strictly based on its feature card. Let me start by carefully reading the provided query and its features.\\n\\nThe QUERY MOLECULE is described as a C78 alpha-mycolate with specific structural features. The SMILES notation given is CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)[O-])[C@H](O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC. From this, I can deduce the molecular formula: 78 carbons, 3 oxygens, and one negative charge. It has a cyclopropyl group and a saturated chain.\\n\\nLooking at the feature card, I see that it's an alpha-mycolate with a saturated C26 alpha-branch. The SMILES indicates a methyl group attached to the hydroxy group, which is part of a 12-cyclopropyl chain. The ring system is a cyclopropyl group.\\n\\nNow, considering the constraints: I should avoid mentioning neighbor, template, or functional reference, and the description should be strictly based on the feature card. I also need to ensure it's factual, not a guess, and in the correct format.\\n\\nSo, the description should mention it\", \"Okay, so I need to generate a factual description of the QUERY MOLECULE strictly based on its feature card. Let me start by carefully reading the provided feature card.\\n\\nThe QUERY MOLECULE has several features: 1,3-benzodioxole, a 1,3-benzodioxole-2-methoxy substituent, a 3-hydroxypropyl substituent, and a 4-methoxy substituent. It's a member of 1-benzofurans and an aromatic ether. It derives from a hydride of a 1-benzofuran.\\n\\nI also see that there are several templates provided, each with different nomenclature styles and scaffolds. My task is to use these templates to generate a description that matches the feature card strictly.\\n\\nLooking at Template 1, which has a scaffold with an O atom at position 7. The SMILES given is COC1=CC(CCCO[C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]2O)=CC2=C1OC(C1=CC3=C(C=C1)OCO3)=C2.\\n\\nFor this template, the description would\", \"Alright, so I need to generate a factual description of this molecule strictly based on its feature card. Let me start by understanding the feature card provided.\\n\\nFirst, the SMILES notation is COC(=O)C=CC1=CC(OC)=C(O)C=C1. Breaking this down, it's a cyclic structure with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a carbon, which is double-bonded to another carbon (C=C). This carbon is connected to a methyl group (C), which is connected to an oxygen (O) and another carbon. That carbon is connected to a ring (C1), which has a double bond (C=C) leading to a carbon with an oxygen (O) and another carbon. This carbon is connected to a methyl group (C) and a hydroxyl group (OH). The ring is a cyclohexene derivative.\\n\\nFrom this, I can infer that the molecule has a structure where a hydroxyl group is attached to a carbon that is part of a cyclohexene ring. The ring has a methyl group and a hydroxyl group, which are in the positions 3 and 4 of the ring.\\n\\nLooking at the feature card, I see that the\", \"Okay, so I need to generate a factual description of the [QUERY MOLECULE] strictly based on its feature card. Let me start by looking at the feature card provided.\\n\\nThe SMILES notation for the molecule is CCOC(=O)[C@H](CCC1=CC=CC=C1)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)O.O=C(O)C=CC(=O)O. So, it's an isoquinoline derivative with an anhydride group.\\n\\nFrom the SMILES, I can see that there's an ethyl ester group (O=C(O)-C-C-) connected to an anhydride (O-C(=O)-O). The rest of the structure is an isoquinoline, specifically the 3S isomer. The substituent on the isoquinoline is a 1-ethoxycarbonyl-4-phenylbutan-2-yl group.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, this is an isoquinoline derivative with an anhydride substituent. The molecule is used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, often as the hydrochloride salt of con\"]\n",

Let me start by understanding what the QUERY MOLECULE is. It's a chemical structure with the SMILES string provided. The feature card lists several properties, including its name, SMILES, molecular weight, etc.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the SMILES string: CSC=CC(=O)SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)[C@H](O)C(C)(C)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)([O-])OC[C@H]1O[C@@H](N2C=NC3=C(N)N=CN=C32)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1OP(=O)([O-])[O-].\\n\\nBreaking this down, it looks like a crotonoyl-CoA(4-) species that has undergone deprotonation at two phosphate and diphosphate sites. The structure includes a crotonoyl group, a CoA(4-) group, and two phosphate groups. The SMILES string suggests that there are two phosphate groups attached to the CoA(4-) group, which is\",\n          \"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to generate a factual description of the QUERY molecule based on the given feature card and context guidelines. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.\\n\\nFirst, the QUERY molecule has a molecular weight of 418.662000 and a high natural abundance of 3. Its elements are carbon and oxygen. The SMILES notation provided is CC(CO)CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3[C@H](O)C[C@@H]4CC(=O)CC[C@@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@@]12C. This SMILES string tells me that the molecule is a steroid with hydroxyl and ketone groups.\\n\\nLooking at the templates, Template 1 and Template 3 both mention 3-oxo-5beta-steroids and 7alpha-hydroxy steroids. Template 1 has a SMILES that includes a ketone group, which matches the QUERY molecule. Template 3 doesn't include a ketone group, so it's less likely. Therefore, I'll go with Template 1.\\n\\nThe QUERY molecule has 30 atoms in\",\n          \"Alright, so I need to generate a factual description of the QUERY MOLECULE based on its feature card. The QUERY MOLECULE has a SMILES notation of CCOC(=O)C1=CC=C(O)C=C1, which I recognize as 4-aminobenzoate. The feature card states that it is a benzoate ester, a substituted aniline, an ethyl ester, a benzoate ester, an ethyl ester, a substituted aniline, and an ethyl ester. \\n\\nFirst, I'll consider the primary features. It's a benzoate ester, so that's straightforward. It's also an ethyl ester, which is another key point. It's a substituted aniline, meaning it has an amino group attached to the benzene ring. The molecule is a member of the catechols, which is a good way to describe it. \\n\\nNow, looking at the other features, it's a benzoate ester, an ethyl ester, a substituted aniline, a benzoate ester, an ethyl ester, a substituted aniline, and an ethyl ester.
